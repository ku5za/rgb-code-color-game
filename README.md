# rgb-code-color-game
In this simple game you can try to match given RGB-code to color sample.

The idea for the game comes from "The Web Developer Bootcamp" course by Colt Steele on Udemy
(https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp).

I haven't watched the solution part and based on look and behaviour of the game presentend
on the video, I've decided to try to make it by myself.

I've also took advantage of the new project to use BEM methodology for the first time.

The whole project is based on HTML, CSS and pure JS.
